# adaex.org | Hi developer! ðŸ™Œ 

Thank you for using this site! I'm so glad you're developing on Cardano. I want to assure you that adaex has a long tradition since ITN, is and will always be available and will only get better as his feature-richer brother adapools.org :) It will always be free and if there are any ads on the site, it will always be the minimum necessary to drive sustainability.
